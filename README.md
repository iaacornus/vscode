Removing the **_CLANKERS_**[^1] and other micro$soft[^2] bullshits that they keep
shoving down our throat; stuff that keeps being re-enabled, stuff that comes back
at every update, and stuff that is not needed but trending i.e. clankers,
chat-whatever-shit. Also, the clanker chat bug that lobotomized programmers
and developers can't live without.

Electron is already too much, why keep adding shit, micro$oft?

> Also, the scripts of VSCodium to strip off micro$soft's telemetry and crap
> is applied to remove the telemetry and spyware bill gates[^3] need to breathe.
