Removing the **_CLANKERS_**[^1] and other micro$soft[^2] bullshits that they keep shoving down our
throat; stuff that keeps being re-enabled, stuff that comes back at every update,
and stuff that is not needed but trending i.e. clankers, chat-whatever-shit. Also, the
clanker chat bug that lobotomized programmers and developers can't live without.

Electron is already too much, why keep adding shit, micro$oft?
